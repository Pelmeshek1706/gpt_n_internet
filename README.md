# GPT + Internet
### made by pelmeshek

this code solves a very common problem - the lack of new knowledge in GPT models. 

This code shows how you can enable the GPT model to google information when needed. 

This task uses:
- langchain==0.0.349.
- openai==0.28.1

I also use [GoogleSerper](https://serper.dev/) as my search engine (which needs its own API key), because DuckDuckGo gives me an error personally. But you can use it as your search engine, it doesn't require an API key
